It is an application that allows the user to record the tasks that he wants to be reminded of, such as a doctor's appointment, class sessions, and other tasks. The application will remind the user of the specific tasks 5-20 minutes before, according to the user's choice, by sending a reminder notification, even if the application is closed ,with the possibility of repeating the reminder every day, week, month or year according to the userâ€™s desire. I used in this project : sqflite, Getx, localnotification
